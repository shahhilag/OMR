<ul>
<li>Our objective is to create a very easy to use yet an efficient app which includes less of complexity and more of accuracy.</li>
<li>Our goal is to eliminate the cumbersome process of scanning and uploading files and still worrying whether the result is efficient or not.</li>
<li>We are willing to design a very simple algorithm through which the user only has to do limited amount of inputs and in return receive highly accurate and precise results.</li>
<li> As far as the structure of our project is concerned, we will:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li> Receive the OMR Sheet image in .jpg,.jpeg or .png format.</li>
<li>In the next step receive the answer sheet uploaded by the user in the .CSV format.</li>
<li>As and when the user clicks on the “See Results button” our backend code will come into action and the results will be displayed.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This seems to sound a bit lengthy but trust us, you will see the results being displayed in a blink of an eye and once the results are displayed you can store the results in your local device by clicking the “download button”.</li>
<li>We have also worked on features like allowing user to input multiple answer to same questions and also displaying the enrolment number of the student from the OMR.</li>
<li>The application is compatible on all web browsers be it in mobile or laptop.We have also created a mobile application to make it usablw to a wide range of audience.</li>
</ul>
